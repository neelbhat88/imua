		<p>The WCSF is funded through individual and business donations, fundraisers, and grant awards. Since January 2012, we have developed a funding base of approximately 50 different contribution sources, most of which come from generous individuals and businesses. All individual contributions are linked to a specific student in the program, and to recognize the donor's generosity, the student provides semesterly updates on their performance throughout HS.</p>
